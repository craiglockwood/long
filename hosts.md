	<h1 class="pageTitle">The Hosts</h1>

	<p class="intro">Knife Talk is hosted by 3 culinary knife makers; Craig Lockwood (<a href="//www.chopknives.com">Chop Knives</a>), Geoff Feder (<a href="//www.federknives.com">Feder Knives</a>) and Mareko Maumasi (<a href="//www.maumasifirearts.com">Maumasi Fire Arts</a>).</p>
	<p>The goal of the show is to share knowledge with the knife making community, chefs and those in the culinary world. Questions can be posed to the hosts via the Knife Talk instagram account (<a href="//www.instagram.com/knifetalkpodcast">@knifetalkpodcast</a>) - the idea is to make the show as interactive as possible. </p>
